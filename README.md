# Types resolution with compilerOptions.paths
Example project with minimal test-case for the type resolution issue in tsc


## Bug Report

In the projects having non-hoisted types we got tsc resolver for type reference directive working differently with or without `compilerOptions.paths` causing failure in resolution in case we have it set.
The example project is attached.

// Example project tree:

‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ node_modules
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ express -> ../.pnpm-v-store/express@4.18.2/node_modules/express

// tsconfig.json:
```
{
    "compilerOptions": {
        "allowJs": true,
        "target": "es6",
        "strict": true,
        "sourceMap": true,
        "skipLibCheck": true,
        "esModuleInterop": true,
        "moduleResolution": "node",
	"baseUrl": "node_modules",
        "paths": { "*": [ "*", "./@types/*" ] }
    },
    "include": [ "src/**/*" ]
}
```


Resolve logs are a bit different in general as with `paths` tsc starts to resolve symlinks, but this doesn't look as a root cause, because it is still able to see the directories in both cases, but the main issue is it just skips search for `{module}/package.json` in case we have `paths`:

To have types out of `node_modules/@types/` I am using use `--public-hoist-pattern ""` for pnpm, this is important on trying to reproduce.

Test case:
1. Untar the attached test-case.tar to any tmp directory
2. Install dependencies with the exact command:
`pnpm i --frozen-lockfile --public-hoist-pattern ""`
3. Run `tsc`, it will fail to resolve type-referene directive 'express-serve-static-core'
4. To get tsc complete successfully remove `paths` from `tsconfig.json` and run `tsc` again.

tsc types with paths, type resolution paths, non-hoisted types and paths


### üïó Version & Regression Information

- This is the behavior in every version I tried, and I reviewed the FAQ for entries about it.

### ‚èØ Playground Link

- The case need both tsconfig.json and specific dependencies, so I can't see a good way to implement it in the playground.

### üíª Code

Test case:
1. Use the test case from this repository
2. Install dependencies with the exact command: `pnpm i --frozen-lockfile --public-hoist-pattern ""`
3. Run `tsc`, it will fail to resolve type-referene directive 'express-serve-static-core'
4. To get tsc complete successfully remove `paths` from `tsconfig.json` and run `tsc` again.

### üôÅ Actual behavior

When compilerOptions.paths is set we got no check for package.json in the referenced module so tsc couldn't resolve the type, in the same time with no `paths` set it could resolve it as package.json is checked and `types` field is taken into accound from there.

### üôÇ Expected behavior

In both scenarios `tsc` should resolve types in the same way keeping it consistent and reliable.
